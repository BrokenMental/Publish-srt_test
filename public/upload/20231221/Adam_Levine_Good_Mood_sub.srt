1
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:07,217
You make me dance, yeah you do

2
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:11,168
You got my heart beatin' rhythms when you move

3
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:15,053
Don't need no plans, feeling loose

4
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:19,025

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,928
When it's good, when it's bad, yeah, you got me

6
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:26,995
Not alone in this town 'cause you make me feel

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,831
Anytime that I call, you'll be ready

8
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:34,835
Anytime, anytime

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,285
And when I turn around, I see you there

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,280
You got a way to make a problem disappear

11
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:48,148
Up to the clouds, I'm spinning 'round

12
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,880
And now you know why

13
00:00:50,905 --> 00:00:54,715
'Cause no one in this world can make me feel loved

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,833
In the way that you do now

15
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:02,533
No, no one in this world can make me come down

16
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,815

We got the sun always shinning wherever we go

21
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:26,523
Don't need no map, we just roll

22
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:30,163
Let the vibe give direction, take control

23
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:34,124
When it's good, when it's bad, yeah, you got me

24
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:38,083
